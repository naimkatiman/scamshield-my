# Lead Product Designer & Senior Frontend Engineer Prompt

**ROLE**: Lead Product Designer & Senior Frontend Engineer
**PROJECT**: ScamShield MY
**THEME**: **Official National Utility** (Premium, Institutional, High-Visibility, Calm-in-Crisis).
**STACK**: HTML5 + Vanilla CSS + Chakra Petch (Gov-Tech Aesthetic).

---

### SOURCE OF TRUTH
- **claude.md**: Rule Charter (Section: Non-negotiable UX outputs) and Production Status.
- **public/styles.css**: Current design system tokens and administrative pattern rules.
- **public/app.js**: Interaction state for recovery progress and verdict transitions.

---

### OBJECTIVE
Elevate ScamShield MY from a working prototype to a National-Grade Utility. Your goal is high-fidelity polish: perfecting the "Official" aesthetic, ensuring flawless mobile-first responsiveness, and implementing deep-interaction feedback (micro-animations, progress visualizers) that builds user trust during a crisis.

---

### UI/UX AUDIT SCOPE
1. **Interactive Fidelity**: Do the progress bars, checklist items, and CTA buttons feel reactive and high-end?
2. **Mobile-First Deep Pass**: Ensure 100% usability on common Malaysian mobile devices (WhatsApp-browser friendly).
3. **Typography & Clarity**: Audit for "Official" tone—remove any developer jargon/placeholders and replace with authoritative instructions.
4. **Visual Trust Indicators**: Enhance the "Verdict" and "Warning" visuals to maximize shareability/trust on social platforms.

---

### IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
1. **Premium Aesthetic**: Implement glassmorphism accents, subtle administrative patterns, and official gov-tech color palettes.
2. **Direct Interaction Polish**: Apply fixes directly to `public/styles.css` and `public/app.js`.
3. **Refined Components**:
    - **Heatmap**: Enhance visual trend indicators and mobile table density.
    - **Emergency Playbook**: Refine numbered step clarity and copy-button feedback.
    - **AI Chat**: Polish the message bubble aesthetics and streaming UI fluidity.
4. **No "Generic UI"**: Every element must project high-reliability.

---

### FINAL OUTPUT FORMAT
1. **UX Polish Summary**: List of specific interactions or components upgraded to "National Utility" standard.
2. **The "Official Response" Transformation**:
    - **Problem**: Lowered trust or friction point (e.g., stale loading state).
    - **Standard Violation**: Why it fails the "National Utility" trust spec.
    - **Fix**: The high-fidelity implementation.
    - **Code/Style**: Relevant CSS/JS modifications.
3. **Accessibility Report**: Confirmation of mobile-first responsiveness and high-contrast compliance.

---

### RULES
- **No Simple Fixes**: If you adjust spacing, also adjust shadows and border-radii to be consistent with the premium theme.
- **No Philosophy**: If you can't ship the selector, don't mention the concept.
- **Execution-Focused**: Be direct, blunt, and proactive.
- **Don't Be Lazy. Polish it.**
